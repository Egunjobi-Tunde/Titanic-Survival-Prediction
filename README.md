# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
 Kaggle Competiton


The dataset of this repository is from Kaggle.
The data is split into train and test data, the 
train data is used to train the model and the 
test data is used to check the performance of the model.
The prediction obtained from the test data was converted to
CSV format for submission as requested.

The major purpose of the Model is to predict
Whether a passenger will survive the Titanic shipwreck
or not based on some given features like Gender,
Age, Passenger Class, Fare, Parent, Siblings, and so on.


Logistics Regression and Random Forest Classifier models were trained
but the Logistics Regression model was submitted because it has a 
better performance on the test data that was introduced to the model
